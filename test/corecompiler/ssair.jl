# Static single-assignment form
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form
#
# In compiler design,
# static single assignment form (often abbreviated as SSA form or simply SSA) is
# a type of intermediate representation (IR) where each variable is assigned exactly once.

# Dominator (graph theory)
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_(graph_theory)
#
# In computer science,
# a node d of a control-flow graph dominates a node n if every path from the entry node to n must go through d.
# Notationally, this is written as d dom n (or sometimes d â‰« n).
# By definition, every node dominates itself.
#
# There are a number of related concepts:
#   - A node d strictly dominates a node n if d dominates n and d does not equal n.
#   - The immediate dominator or idom of a node n is the unique node that strictly dominates n
#     but does not strictly dominate any other node that strictly dominates n.
#     Every node reachable from the entry node has an immediate dominator (except the entry node).
#   - The dominance frontier of a node d is the set of all nodes ni such that d dominates an immediate predecessor of ni,
#     but d does not strictly dominate ni. It is the set of nodes where d's dominance stops.
#   - A dominator tree is a tree where each node's children are those nodes it immediately dominates.
#     The start node is the root of the tree.
